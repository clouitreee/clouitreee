I'm clouitreee
Cybersecurity practitioner with more than five years of enterprise IT-support experience and a newly earned Google Cybersecurity Certificate. I specialise in blue-team analysis, network forensics, SIEM correlation (Splunk/ELK) and Python automation grounded in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. My hands-on background spans Microsoft endpoint hardening, packet analysis with Wireshark and tcpdump, and vulnerability prioritisation following the OWASP Top 10. I am currently refining AI-assisted detection workflows and threat-hunting playbooks that reduce MTTR and help defenders stay ahead of adversaries. Ready to bring this mix of curiosity, rigour and clear communication to a forward-thinking security operations environment.

Pronouns he/him — I still read technical documentation like others read novels and enjoy turning everyday IT headaches into elegant, automated fixes.
